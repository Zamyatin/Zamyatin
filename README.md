## Me: In a Nutshell

Once avid skateboarder and builder of sweet skateboard half pipes and Robinson Cursoe styled treehouses.

Former thesbian and Chicago styled improv comedy geek.

Former screenwriter (though I still write for fun).  Now it's mostly technical writing.

Former (but still practicing non-professionally) political scientist who wonks out to Technology Policy, International Relations, Domestic Fiscal Policy, and old-fashioned (and oft dismissed) Political Theory & Philosophy.

Current DevOps Engineer (`Class: SRE`) with 25 years in the field building and managing networks, datacenters, distributed applications, and enabling Enterprise "cloud native" architecture transitions. Been on all sides - old-school IT, hardware, software, onPrem, cloud, operations _and_ applications engineer. I've worked in enterprise, startups, have consulted others, and been consulted.

### How I Roll

Always looking out for the underdog who is asked of too much. Hates "toil". Builds intelligent robots to reduce toil as much as possible. 

Enjoys playing "go-between" roles that jump between development and operations. Master of none, but I'm comfortable deeper in the stack than most.

Enjoys building and managing teams that break down those silos where possible, or streamlines communication and cooperative effot when separation of concerns is necessary.

I've seen the rise and fall of Netscape, AOL, Internet Explorer, MySpace. I've watched a slew of .COMs that missed the point of the 'Net, act as bad faith citizens, and become gatekeepers or data-usurpers of an open and free knowledge transmission system that is founded in trust. I hope it doesn't last, and so, I contribute to OSS, open protocols, and open system designs as much as I can, in whatever capacity I can.

Interested in the ever-present balance between individual rights and welfare of society (both philosophically and as rights represented technologically).

Current burgeoning fascination with [Web3](https://bernardmarr.com/what-is-web3-all-about-an-easy-explanation-with-examples/) distributed web, [trustless system](https://law.mit.edu/pub/trustinatrustlesssystem/release/1) design, digital privacy and secure utility, and a coexistant technological and legal framework for personal digital rights that appreciates the needs of society, *and* a healthy respect for nature. Thoroughly attracted to the possibilities such advancement can affect an iterative-but-always-progressive civililzation.

I love bright colors - hot pink and bright blue are my jam. Since it's not the '80s anymore, I wear black, like, a LOT. I am terrible at UI. Don't ask me to draw boxes on the screen because color choice and shapes make no sense to me. 

Deeply appreciative and enraptured by people who understand that visual art and design. It's magic. :)

### Cool Internet Policy Quote

## Technology that tickles me nibblets

- Toolchains that enable GitOps at scale
- Providers, systems, and tools that enable rapid iteration, reduce toil, and make life easier for stakeholders to Get Stuff Done.
- Distributed, trustless compute across the Network: IPFS, Blockchain/Distributed Ledger, etc
- Enabling Data Democratization and data-driven intelligence
- Developer Sanity: easing cognitive load on devs who just want to build in Cloud Native ways
- Portable Dev Environments for Docker, Kubernetes, NixOS

Insofar as centralized services are concerned: I really do enjoy [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com/), [**Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/). [**Hashicorp**](https://www.hashicorp.com/) stack as well. 

Not all centralized systems are fundamentally "bad", and I find, ironically, Google is a relatively benevolent citizen in the open source community; and GCP is probably the least of the major cloud providers to force vendor lock-in. 

By comparison, I remain *sus* around Azure (still remember the '90s era Microsoft), but they seem to be playing along more considerately now. Jury's still out. I *do* love VSCode, and they haven't wrecked GitHub. So props where props are due, right? :)
