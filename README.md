## Me: In a Nutshell

Once avid skateboarder and builder of sweet skateboard half pipes and Robinson Cursoe styled treehouses.

Former thesbian and Chicago styled improv comedy geek.

Former screenwriter (though I still write for fun).  Now it's mostly technical writing.

Former (but still practicing non-professionally) political scientist who wonks out to Technology Policy, International Relations, Domestic Fiscal Policy, and old-fashioned (and oft dismissed) Political Theory & Philosophy.

Current DevOps Engineer (`Class: SRE`) with 25 years in the field building and managing networks, datacenters, distributed applications, and enabling Enterprise "cloud native" architecture transitions. Been on all sides - old-school IT, hardware, software, onPrem, cloud, operations _and_ applications engineer. I've worked in enterprise, startups, have consulted others, and been consulted.

## Tech Stacks
I enjoy started writing in **Ruby** and raw **JS**, have moved to **Go**, and am currently learning **Rust**. Experience with **Java & Spring Cloud**, although I'm no master. Spring (or anything JRE) seems heavy for microservices, but it's battle tested. Kotlin could be interesting, but still JRE.

**Typescript** is the only way I surive Javascript/Node environments these days. :) Obviously working in systems, I am perfectly comfortable in **bash** and **Powershell** (when necessary).

Coding Bucket List: 
* Learn Lisp, Haskell, Elixir.
* Wrap head around functional programming concepts at a deep level.
* Play in "big" data more & take a dive into **Julia**.
* Figure out if [**Bazel**](https://bazel.build) is the end-all be-all of build systems.

I have supported hundreds of concurrent services running at Enterprise scale in Java, Node, Elixir, Go, Ruby, and Python. 

I can also get around some frontend frameworks. Most comfortable in React, but can get around in Vue and Angular. I started in Ember and Backbone, and hope to never go back - it inevitably turns into Code Spaghetti!

Deployment environments include **Kubernetes**, straight **VM**, and **"serverless"** service architectures (Cloud Functions, Cloud Run/Knative stacks). Often mixed environments where the service fits the job.
* Cloud: Google Cloud, AWS, some Azure (prefer GCP > Azure > AWS)
* OnPrem: VMWare vSphere, Citrix Hypervisor/XenServer/VDI

I've designed, provisioned, and maintained a number of scalable data persistence solutions. 
* Most relational RDBs (PostgreSQL, Mysql, T-SQL)
* Document stores (Elasticsearch, CouchDB, Mongo). I've poked around MarkLogic, but that's serious $$$.
* Graph DBs: Azure Cosmos, Neo4j
* Redis Cache


***Fun Fact:*** I'd actually got Elasticsearch running in Kubernertes for Enterprise-scale production before it was ever *officially* supported in containerized, auto-managed environments supporting horizontal scaling. **Don't try that at home, kids!** 

**Infrastructure as Code** tooling primarily in **Terraform**, **Ainsible**, **Puppet**, and **Chef**. Some Saltstack back in the day. 

I prefer constructing VM images as code through Hashicorp Packer (learning NixOS). 

I'm currently trying to figure out how/where the DevOps/SRE practice fits into a blockchain project SDLC.

## How I Roll

Always looking out for the underdog who is asked of too much. Hates "toil". Builds intelligent robots to reduce toil as much as possible. 

Enjoys playing "go-between" roles that jump between development and operations. Master of none, but I'm comfortable deeper in the stack than most.

Enjoys building and managing teams that break down those silos where possible, or streamlines communication and cooperative effot when separation of concerns is necessary.

I've seen the rise and fall of Netscape, AOL, Internet Explorer, MySpace. I've watched a slew of .COMs that missed the point of the 'Net, act as bad faith citizens, and become gatekeepers or data-usurpers of an open and free knowledge transmission system that is founded in trust. I hope it doesn't last, and so, I contribute to OSS, open protocols, and open system designs as much as I can, in whatever capacity I can.

Interested in the ever-present balance between individual rights and welfare of society (both philosophically and as rights represented technologically).

Current burgeoning fascination with [Web3](https://bernardmarr.com/what-is-web3-all-about-an-easy-explanation-with-examples/) distributed web, [trustless system](https://law.mit.edu/pub/trustinatrustlesssystem/release/1) design, digital privacy and secure utility, and a coexistant technological and legal framework for personal digital rights that appreciates the needs of society, *and* a healthy respect for nature. Thoroughly attracted to the possibilities such advancement can affect an iterative-but-always-progressive civililzation.

I love bright colors - hot pink and bright blue are my jam. Since it's not [the '80s anymore](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/193584483959826498/), I wear black, like, a LOT. I am terrible at UI. Don't ask me to draw boxes on the screen because color choice and shapes make no sense to me. 

Deeply appreciative and enraptured by people who understand that visual art and design. It's magic. :)

## Technology that "Tickles me Nibblets"

- Toolchains that enable [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) at scale
- Providers, systems, and tools that enable rapid iteration, reduce toil, and make life easier for stakeholders to Get Stuff Done.
- Distributed, trustless compute across the Network: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), Blockchain/Distributed Ledger, etc.
- Enabling Data Democratization and data-driven intelligent decision making
- Developer Sanity: easing cognitive load on devs who just want to build in Cloud Native ways
- Sorting out the simplest portable Dev Environments (currently using Docker, Kubernetes, NixOS)
- Designing fast, modular, dynamic, ephemeral testing environments
- Discovering new (to me) testing tools and patterns

Insofar as centralized services are concerned: I really do enjoy [**Google Cloud Platform**](https://cloud.google.com/), [**Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), and [**Kubernetes**](https://kubernetes.io/). [**Hashicorp**](https://www.hashicorp.com/) stack as well. 

Not all centralized systems are fundamentally "bad", and I find, ironically, Google is a relatively benevolent citizen in the open source community; and GCP is probably the least of the major cloud providers to force vendor lock-in. 

By comparison, I remain *sus* around Azure (still remember the '90s era Microsoft), but they seem to be playing along more considerately now. Jury's still out. I *do* love VSCode, and they haven't wrecked GitHub. So props where props are due, right? :)

## My Profile Stats:
Not that it matters, since most my work the last few years has been in private repos outside of GitHub... but I thought this was cool and I liked the colors. Thanks [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra) for this sweet tally tool. 

I'll use this as inspiration/motivation to get busy on OSS again!
