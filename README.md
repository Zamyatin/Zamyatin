## Me: In a Nutshell

Once avid skateboarder and builder of sweet skateboard half pipes and Robinson Cursoe styled treehouses.

Former thesbian and Chicago styled improv comedy geek.

Former screenwriter (though I still write for fun). Now it's mostly technical writing.

Former (but still practicing non-professionally) political scientist who wonks out to Technology Policy, International
Relations, Domestic Fiscal Policy, and old-fashioned (and oft dismissed) Political Theory & Philosophy.

Current DevOps Engineer (`Class: SRE`) with 25 years in the field building and managing networks, datacenters,
distributed applications, and enabling Enterprise "cloud native" architecture transitions. Been on all sides -
old-school IT, hardware, software, onPrem, cloud, operations _and_ applications engineer. I've worked in enterprise, in
startups, have consulted others, and have been consulted.

## Tech Stacks

I started writing in **Ruby** and raw **JS**, I've worked in **Python**, supported **Java/Spring** . Recently I've taken
a fascination with **Go**, and have been dabbling in **Rust** and server-side Swift. At the end of the day, I honestly
believe Go will replace Python as the defacto language for Operations (if it hasn't already) - including, possibly,
scripting. I'm digging Rust because it really forces an understanding of computing, but really holding out hope for
server-side Swift as it is far more composable, and seems to provide the same (or possibly better) memory safety.

My experience with **Java & Spring Cloud** is primarily in application delivery, support, and some debugging. Spring (or
anything JRE) always seemed heavy for microservices (especially in the containerized world). Finally, **Typescript** is
the only way I surive Javascript/Node environments these days. :) Obviously working in systems, I am perfectly
comfortable in **bash** and **Powershell** (though if you're scripting in Bash or Powershell that's a systems smell to
me, and I'd argue you should be using or building a tool).

I have supported hundreds of concurrent services running at Enterprise scale in Java/Spring, Go, Elixir, Node, Ruby, and
Python.

I can also navigate frontend frameworks - React, Angular, Vue, Ember, Backbone. I'm far from calling myself a frontend
dev, but I started in Ember and Backbone, and eventually moved to React, then Angular

Deployment environments include **Kubernetes**, straight **VM**, and **"serverless"** service architectures (Cloud
Functions, Cloud Run/Knative stacks). Often mixed environments where the service fits the job.

- Cloud: Google Cloud, AWS, some Azure (prefer GCP > Azure > AWS)
- OnPrem: VMWare vSphere, Citrix Hypervisor/XenServer/VDI

I've designed, provisioned, and maintained a number of scalable data persistence solutions.

- Most modern relational RDBs (PostgreSQL, MySQL, T-SQL)
- Document stores (Elasticsearch, CouchDB, Mongo). I've poked around MarkLogic, but that's serious $$$.
- Graph DBs: Azure Cosmos, Neo4j
- Others: Redis Cache, Google Cloud Datastore & BigQuery
- Various Extract/Translate/Load processes
- Message Queues: RabbitMQ, Google Cloud PubSub/AWS SMS/Azure MQ, Apache Kafka

### Preferred Systems Composition Stacks

- Terraform
- NixOS
- Packer
- Ainsible
- Puppet
- Chef
- Saltstack

### Coding Bucket List:

- [ ] Improve GoLang (this is the future in my field)
- [ ] Improve Rust skills
- [ ] Play in Zig
- [ ] Learn Lisp, Haskell, Elixir.
- [ ] Wrap head around functional programming. Why is this so hard to debug??
- [ ] Play in "big" data more & take a dive into **Julia**.
- [ ] Figure out if [**Bazel**](https://bazel.build) is the end-all be-all of build systems.

## How I Roll

Always looking out for the underdog who is asked of too much. Hates "toil". Builds intelligent robots to reduce toil as
much as possible.

Enjoys playing "go-between" roles that jump between development and operations. Master of none, but I'm comfortable
deeper on the right side of the stack than most software devs. Being focused on one side or the other for too long lets
me get rusty; hence, playing the diplomat.

Enjoys building and managing teams that break down silos where possible, or streamlines communication and cooperative
effot when separation of concerns is necessary. _Loves_ sharing knowledge. :school: :metal:

I've seen the rise and fall of Netscape, AOL, Internet Explorer, MySpace. I've watched a slew of .COMs that missed the
point of the 'Net, act as bad faith citizens, and become gatekeepers or data-usurpers of an open and free knowledge
transmission system that is founded in trust. I hope it doesn't last, and so, I contribute to OSS, open protocols, and
open system designs as much as I can, in whatever capacity I can.

Interested in the ever-present balance between individual rights and welfare of society (both philosophically and as
rights represented technologically).

Current burgeoning fascination with
[Web3](https://bernardmarr.com/what-is-web3-all-about-an-easy-explanation-with-examples/) distributed web,
[trustless system](https://law.mit.edu/pub/trustinatrustlesssystem/release/1) design, digital privacy with secured
utility, and a coexistant technological and legal framework for personal digital rights that appreciates the needs of
society, _and_ a healthy respect for nature.

I love bright colors - hot pink and bright blue are my jam. Since it's not
[the '80s anymore](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/193584483959826498/), I wear black, like, a LOT. I am terrible at UI.
Don't ask me to draw boxes on the screen because color choice and shapes make no sense to me.

:heart: Deeply appreciative and enraptured by people who understand that visual art and design. It's magic. :heart:

### Cool Internet Policy Quote

"The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it." - _John Gilmore_, founder: _Electronic Frontier
Foundation_

## Technology that Tickles me Insides

- Toolchains that enable [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) at scale
- Providers, systems, and tools that enable rapid iteration, reduce toil, and make life easier for stakeholders to Get
  Stuff Done.
- Open Source Projects that allow the privacy and self-agency of self-hosted compute. _Especially_ in lieu of this
  modern "let them rent _everything_ and own _nothing_" era.
- Participation in ways to keep the Software Supply Chain safe and secure
- Distributed, trustless compute across the Network: [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), Blockchain/Distributed Ledger, etc.
- Enabling Data Democratization and data-driven intelligent decision making
- Developer Sanity: easing cognitive load on devs who just want to build in Cloud Native ways
- Sorting out the simplest portable Dev Environments (currently using Docker, Kubernetes, NixOS)
- Designing fast, modular, dynamic, ephemeral testing environments
- Discovering new (to me) testing tools and patterns - Fuzzing, PIT Mutation, etc.

### Random Thoughts on Blockchain Tech

1. I agree with Moxie Marlinspike's sentiment, "I don't share the same generational excitement for moving all aspects of
   life to an instrumented economy."[^1]. However, I recognize a certain inevitability. I _also_ recognize there are
   valid use cases for blockchain ledgers and dApps in areas where massive legal frameworks such as that in the US which
   enable ownership and trade, simply don't exist, or are so corrupt as to be worse than not existing at all.

1. The challenges of
   [inclusive accountability](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/10/29/mithril-a-stronger-and-lighter-blockchain-for-better-efficiency/)
   and simple-to-run _distributed_ infrastructure (as the preference of the Web3 paradigm avoids centralization) _are_
   real challenges. But, you know, that's what makes all this stuff cool and geeky to poke around at. It feels like the
   old "Web1" days, when anything's possible.

## Profile Stats:

Not that it matters, since most my work the last few years has been in private repos outside of GitHub... but I thought
this was cool and I liked the colors. Thanks [Anurag Hazra](https://github.com/anuraghazra) for this sweet tally tool.

I'll use this as inspiration/motivation to get busy on OSS again!
